 * statistical inference tests that use a distribution but not the RNG (cf. MATH-1124) which now deprecated code passed to its contructor.

Integrator returns the full state, not only the time.
Step interpolator only needs the mapper, not the full equations.
Initialize primary and secondary equations at integration start.
Use MapArrays utility methods for building arrays.
Added init methods for primary and secondary ODE.

This addition is for consistency with other user-implemented interfaces
as step handlers and event handlers. However, since the equations have
only the state as input and the produce derivatives as output, their
init method also only uses state, as derivatives can be computed only
after equations have been initialized, not before.
Separate equations from mapper.
Implementation of the top level abstract classes in field ode.

This layer implements boilerplate code, mainly step handling and events
handling. It is independent of the type of integrator used. Below this
layer will be the real implementations (Runge-Kutta, embedded
runge-Kutta, Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer, Adams, ...).
Top level integrator interface.

We have merged together what was initially in an integrator interface
and in an AbstractIntegrator class. The separation was only due to
backward compatibility issues which prevented to push some functions up
in the interface. A consequence was that users needed to use the
abstract class in their declaration as soon as they needed the
additional features ... which was most of the cases. We try to fix this
here. When 4.0 will be out, the same merging will be done in the
double[] implementation of ode.

JIRA: MATH-1288
Mapping between primary/secondary equations and flat arrays.

The API is much simpler than the one in the current double[]
implementation. We do not mix anymore the equations and the state.

JIRA: MATH-1288
Interface and enum for event handling.

This corresponds to an improved g-stop feature. It basically allow to
manage discrete events that occur during ode integration. when the event
occurs, user can decide to log it and continue, or to change the
dynamics of a problem (for example to handle derivatives
discontinuities) or even to stop the integration before its target date
(for example when the exact final date cannot be known beforehand but is
discovered on the fly). It is the second major feature of our ode
package.
Interfaces and normalizer for step handling.

This corresponds to a continuous output feature. It basically allow to
navigate throughout current step instead of having only discrete grid
points. It is a major feature of our ode package.

JIRA: MATH-1288
Starting work on Field-based ordinary differential equations.

The base elements are the primary equation that users must implement,
and optional secondary equations to support features like adjoint
parameters or variational equations. Some containers to hold current
state are also introduced to simplify API (these container do not exist
in the double[] version of the API).

PairNeuronDouble should not implement Comparable.

As the purpose was only to sort neurons according to an associated

induces also implementing equals and hashcode which are not really
meaningful. They are nevertheless required by our code quality checking

Attempt to circumvent some errors which seem to be platform-dependent.

The Jenkins build often fails on code that seems to be perfectly
correct. Failures also do no always happen so they may depend on
platform. There were similar problems a few months ago that were
probably related to JIT bugs.

This fix simply tries to do the same thing as before, but with an
earlier detection of NaN in one case, and by comparing directly the bits
representation in another case, to avoid wrong optimizations.Fixed missing javadoc.Add userguide example for integer distributions. Fix title in real distribution overview.

"LaplaceDistribution": Fixed special case of inverse cumulative distribution.
Connect closest node instead of first node below threshold in polygons.Fixed comment, the test for MATH-1174 does not fail anymore.Typo.Deprecated AVLTree and OrderedTuple.

These two classes were dirty hacks used only for the extraction of
boundary from 2D Euclidean BSP trees. They were not really efficient and
produces some problems as topology was not preserved.

A completely new implementation of boundary extraction has been set up
as of 3.4, that preserves more topological information and therefore
should be more robust. This new implementation does not use these
classes anymore.

As AVLTree is not really a math concept, this class is not considered to
belong to [math] scope. OrderedTuple is more a grey zone, but it is
really something inefficient and no need for it is foreseen.Fixed a problem with too thin polygons considered to have infinite size.
Removed development traces.set up a weak link between a line and its reverse to avoid duplications.
Added splitters in Boundary attributes.
Reorganized code, avoiding too many internal classes.Improved accuracy of internal computation.

The improvement is obtained by using high accuracy linear combinations
and by preserving cos/sin as much as possible. This last part is
important in the frequent case of lines along y axis, i.e. when angle is
π/2. We want the cosine to remain 0 and not get about 10^-17. Identified a new failure mode for polygons.Merge branch 'master' of https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-math

Fix checker seeing not old point

ConvergenceCheckers always saw previous.getPoint() to equal
current.getPoint() because the optimizers used the same array and did

In LeastSquaresProblem.Evaluation removed the getValue() method.

- The residuals are the really the values of the objective function
  that is being minimized.
- Forcing the value to be a real vector and the residual computed
  through subtraction is an unnecessary constraint. For example
  Rotation.distance() will compute a better residual than
  subtracting the quaternion elements of two rotations.
- Method was not used by any optimizer.

Make QR the default in GaussNewtonOptimizer

Theoretically QR offers the best blend of speed and numerical stability.
Empirically the QR implementation is slightly faster than the Cholesky
implementation.

Add Cholesky option to GaussNewtonOptimizer

Since the normal matrix is symmetric positive (semi-)definite, the
Cholesky decomposition is theoretically faster.

Make QR in GaussNewton faster and more accurate

Re-factored the code in GaussNewtonOptimizer so that the decomposition
algorithm sees the Jacobian and residuals instead of the normal
equation. This lets the QR algorithm operate directly on the Jacobian
matrix, which is faster and less sensitive to numerical errors. As a
result, one test case that threw a singular matrix exception now passes
with the QR decomposition.

The refactoring also include a speed improvement when computing the
normal matrix for the LU decomposition. Since the normal matrix is
symmetric only half of is computed, which results in a factor of 2 speed
up in computing the normal matrix for problems with many more
measurements than states.

Use Real{Vector,Matrix} in LeastSquares interfaces

Covered all of the interfaces in the leastsquares package to use RealVector and
RealMatrix instead of double[] and double[][]. This reduced some duplicated code.
For example Evaluation.computeResiduals() was a complete duplication of
RealVector.subtract(). It also presents a consistent interface and allows data
encapsulation.

Lastly, this change enables [math] to "eat our own dog food." It enables the
linear package to be used in the implementation of the optimization algorithms.

Use Evaluation instead of PointVectorValuePair

Use Evaluation instead of PointVectorValuePair in the ConvergenceChecker. This
gives the checkers access to more information, such as the rms and covariances.
The change also simplified the optimizer implementations since they no longer
have to keep track of the current function value.

A method was added to LeastSquaresFactory to convert between the two types of
checkers and a method added to LeastSquaresBuilder so that it can accept either
type. I would have prefered to do this through method overloading, but
overloading doesn't play well with generics.

Use enum for LU or QR in GaussNewtonOptimizer

Changed the boolean useLu prarameter to an enum. This is benificial because:

Value and Jacobian evaluated in a single method.

A new interface MultivariateJacobianFunction lets the function value and

Implicit Weights

The weights are no longer implicit in LeastSquaresProblem.Evaluation. They are
already included in the computed residuals and Jacobian.

GN and LM multiplied the residuals by the weights immediately, so that was easy
to remove.

Created an AbstractEvaluation class which handles the derived quantitied (cost,
rms, covariance,...) and two implementations. UnweightedEvaluation uses the
straight forward formulas. DenseWeightedEvaluation delegates to an Evaluation
and multiples the residuals and Jacobian by the square root of the weight matrix
before returning them. Allowed me to remove the reference to the full weight
matrix.

Separate least squares algorithm from problem.

The least squares package now has two main interfaces LeastSquaresOptimizer and
LeastSquaresProblem, where the optimizer can be applied to the problem.

In this commit all of the test cases pass with one change (annotated) to
LevenbergMarquardt.testControlParameters(). The tests for Gauss Newton were
expanded to cover using the QR decomposition, which revealed a QR default
tolerance discrepancy.

A factory and a mutable builder were create for LeastSquaresProblem.

Added a getEnclosingCap method for spherical polygons.

In simple cases (small polygon, one piece only, no holes), the enclosing
cap will be the smallest one, but this is not guaranteed in the general
case.

The enclosing cap can be used to speed up inside/outside points when the
region is small with respect to the sphere as with only one check of an
angular separation, most points of the sphere can be safely identified
as outside. The more time-consuming checks involving the full boundary
are therefore done only for a small portion of the sphere.

In almost coplanar / almost colinear cases, sphere generation could
diverge in such a way the support points did not belong to the sphere
anymore! This new implementation uses exact arithmetic for the

generated during the Welzl algorithm execution, this is probably
acceptable.

BSP tree now provide an API to compute a global signed distance.

The distance is defined from a test point to the region. It is positive
if the point is outside of the region, negative if the point is inside,
and zero when the point is at the boundary. The distance is continuous
everywhere, so it can be used with a root solver to identify accurately
boundary crossings. This API is available for all BSP trees, in
Euclidean and spherical geometries, and in all dimensions.

Don't advertise an assumption we may remove soon.

We will probably extend the circle class to also represent small circles
on the 2-sphere, not only great circles. This would introduce an
aperture angle that could be different from \pi/2. In this case, the
part of a circle inside another circle may exist or not (small circles
can be disjoint), and may have a length either shorter or longer than
\pi.

This change is not done yet, but could happen any time soon, even before
3.3 is out.

Removed Java6 @Override annotations.

@Override is needed in Java6 when implementing an interface, but is
allowed only when overriding a previous implementation in Java5. Apache
Commons Math currently targets Java5, so these annotations were
spurious.

Added method to compute a^x for double a and DerivativeStructure x.

This takes care of special cases like a=0, but encounters the same
limitation as rootN near the singularity 0^0. Combined derivatives like
order 2 or higher with respect to canonical variables give NaN and not
+/-infinity. First derivative with respect to a single variable works
well and provided the correct infinity.

MATH-1008
Created package "o.a.c.m.fitting.leastsquares" to contain a modified version
of the contents of (to-be-deprecated) "o.a.c.m.optim.nonlinear.vector", the
main purpose being to provide a new "fluent" API (cf. "withXxx" methods).  
Along the way, class "LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer" has been further cleaned    
up (e.g. removing protected fields and deprecated methods and using local
variables instead of instance fields).
An additional constructor was necessary in "BaseOptimizer".

Improved reporting section in pom.xml.

The Apache RAT plugin was configured in the build section instead of the
reporting section, so it did not automatically used our local
configuration.

The checkstyle anf findbugs plugins were updated to recent versions,
with some adaptation to prevent double entries.

The CPD plugin has been temporarily disabled because in 3.X it detects
huge duplications, which is true but misleading, as the duplications are
a consequence of our upward compatibility policy.

appears it is original work and NOT a derived work from Mixtools.
In fact, Mixtools was used mainly to verify the results and generate
some reference data (see the Junit test cases). Neither the code nor the
API from Mixtools were used.

MATH-817
Algorithem for fitting of a multivariate normal distributions mixture
(implemented by Jared Becksfort).
Added "MixtureMultivariateNormalDistribution" class as "syntactic sugar".
Two unit tests are currently set to "@Ignore" (because they rely on "equals"
which the patch did not seem to implement "equals" consistently).

Added a way to trigger only increasing or decreasing events in ODE.

The method used is completely different from what was suggested in the
request report. It is fully compatible with previous versions and most
importantly has no side effects on users that do not need this feature,
as it is based on an upstream filtering of the event definition
function. The events detection logic is not modified and it fact it does
not even know events are filtered before they are detected.

Made EmpiricalDistribution smoothing kernel pluggable.
To enable subclasses to provide the enclosing distribution's underlying RandomGenerator
to distribution constructors, two more changes were required:
* In EmpiricalDistribution, the RandomDataGenerator field (randomData) was changed
  from private to protected.
* The private getRan() method in RandomDataGenerator returning the underlying
  RandomGenerator was renamed getRandomGenerator and made public.

Removed the log10 declaration in RealFieldElement interface.

This method introduced a binary incompatibility as one implementing

The method will be added back in the interface for 4.0, when it will be
allowed to change the return type for Dfp.

Added exclude filters for RAT.

Many Apache license headers have been added in previous commits
(r1454703, r1454718, r1454719, r1454721, r1454722, r1454723). However
some test data files cannot be changed (empty file, files published by
by NIST), and in fact the content of this files is public, so they
cannot be subject to Apache license, so they are excluded from the RAT
report.

Added a new ExtendedFieldElement interface.

This interface represents anything that is real number like. It is
implemented by Decimal64, Dfp and DerivativeStructure. The purpose of
this interface is to be able to set up general algorithms that apply on
real numbers (maybe complex too) and use genericity.

A first use case corresponds to 3D geometry objects (Vector3D and
Rotation).

MATH-874
Refactored of the contents of package "o.a.c.m.optimization"
into the new "o.a.c.m.optim" and "o.a.c.m.fitting" packages.
* All deprecated classes/fields/methods have been removed in the
  replacement packages.
* Simplified API: a single "optimize(OptimizationData... data)"
  for all optimizer types.
* Simplified class hierarchy, merged interfaces and abstract
  classes, only base classes are generic.
* The new classes do not use the "DerivativeStructure" type.

Added lower and upper boundaries to finite differences.

When a function is defined only on an interval, finite differences
should not attempt to compute sample points outside this interval. This
case is now detected properly and the sample is shifted if needed. This
may result in some loss of accuracy as the formula is not centered
anymore, but at least we should not get catastrophic errors or
exceptions.

In classes o.a.c.m3.special.Gamma and o.a.c.m3.special.Beta, made some
auxiliary functions package private. It is very unlikely that these functions
should be used outside this package, and if necessary, it will always be
possible to increase their visibility (while the reverse would break
compatibility).

Use the new differentation API for all optimizers.

The older API is still supported as of version 3.1, but is implemented
by wrapping the user function into the new API and then calling the new

Finalized fix for MATH-880.

This version should be much more robust on polygons computation than the
earlier ones. Note that the hyperplaneThickness parameter is a key
tuning parameter in difficult cases like the one involved in the issue.
As shown in the corresponding unit test, the value had to be raised to
1.0e-8 in order for the test to pass correctly.

MATH-867
Previous commit was missing a crucial modification (in the "repair" method),
an inconsistency which entailed the failing of some tests.
With that modification (thanks to Nikolaus Hansen), it was established that
the "encode" and "decode" steps were indeed useless. This commit thus removes
them, and all the code that was necessary only because of those two methods.
Finite and infinite can now be freely mixed.
Unit tests that depended on those limitations were also removed (thus also
the one that was added following MATH-865).

MATH-867
Modified "encode" and "decode" methods. Unit test "testFitAccuracyDependsOnBoundary"
now passes and is thus enabled. Unit test "testConstrainedRosen" had to be modified
in order to not fail with the new code (starting point is set closer to the solution).

MATH-854
  - filled the "throws" clause of Array2DRowRealMatrix,
  - corrected some method signatures in RealMatrix and AbstractRealMatrix accordingly,
  - in AbstractRealMatrix, removed "abstract implementations" of some methods specified in interface RealMatrix, as they serve no purpose.

MATH-863
New "Quaternion" class. Thanks to Julien Anxionnat.
After applying the original patch, the following changes were made:
* Renamed the "static" quaternion instances ("PLUS_" prefix removed).
* Removed some (syntactic sugar) methods; removed or modified corresponding
  unit tests.
* Made the redundant accessors call the "canonic" ones.
* Removed the default tolerance and added an explicit tolerance parameter
  in methods that depend on equality testing.
* When a "ZeroException" is thrown, the actual value of the norm is provided
  in the detailed message (as the implementation actually does not use a
  strict comparison with 0).
* Added "equals(Object)" and "hashCode" methods.
* Javadoc and formatting. Added license header.
* Removed "toString" documentation (as this representation should not be
  binding). Changed the representation to not use a comma.
* Renamed "scalarMultiply" to "multiply".
* More stringent tolerance used in the unit tests assertions, whenever
  possible.
* Added unit tests.

Fail early on wrong derivation order.

If the user asks for a derivation order that is too large for the number
of points in the finite differences algorithm, we now detect it before
the first call to the underlying function.

Added a FiniteDifferencesDifferentiator class.

This class implements both UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator,
UnivariateVectorFunctionDifferentiator and
UnivariateMatrixFunctionDifferentiator. It is not limited in the
derivation order, but checks the order is consistent with the number of
points. Typically, attempting to extract 5th derivative from a 3 points
scheme will not work (a NumberIsTooLargeException will be thrown,
referencing the derivation order).

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/trunk@1386745 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
Added a way to create DerivativeStructure from all derivatives.

In some cases, users may already have all the derivatives available at
once. It was impossible to use this knowledge and create the object, so
users had to user dirty tricks like adding together variables holding
value and zero derivative with variables holding derivatives and zero
value.

Differentiable function can trigger any MathIllegalArgumentException.

One very important case corresponds to an unsupported derivation order.
The order is not enforced in the API, but is specified as the properties
of the DerivativeStructure argument, as well as the number of free
parameters. Some functions have no limitation on this order (typically
functions implemented using only the DerivativeStructure API), but some
functions may limit the derivation order to 1 or 2 as they implement the
differentiation themselves or through finite differences.

Use the new differentiation framework in optimization package.

As a temporary hack for backward compatibility, some optimizers do
provide "optimize" methods which accept the new functions signatures
(i.e. MultivariateDifferentiableXxxFunction), but they do *not*
advertise it in their "implements" clause. The reason for that is that
Java forbid implementing a parameterized interface with two different
parameters. These optimizers already implement the interface with the
older functions signatures, and this cannot be removed as of 3.1.

When 4.0 will be started, the old signatures will be removed, and the
"implements" declarations will be updated.

Fixed too large memory consumption in DSCompiler.

Prior to this correction, when at one point in a program a user needed a
derivative with 1 parameter and order 5, and at another point needed a
derivative with 30 parameters and order 1, all DSCompilers from 1x1 to
30x5 were created. As the compilation rules for 30 parameters and 5
order are huge, this failed with memory heap errors after several
gigabytes were consumed.

The fix is to simply build the necessary compilers, and let the array
contain null references for the compilers never used (these null
references will be populated later if the user ask for some intermediate
value that need them, of course).

Deprecated DifferentiableUnivariateFunction.

The interface and its implementations should be removed for 4.0. The
remaining uses in the library are only there for compatibility.
Everything else now use the new UnivariateDifferentiableFunction
interface and DerivativeStructure, which allow both arbitrary
differentiation order and arbitrary number of free parameters.

The next step for 3.1 is to replace the multidimensional functions (i.e.
multivariate functions, vector valued functions and matrix valued
functions).

Code update. Unit test.


git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/trunk@1370984 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
Added a new package dealing with differentials.

The package is intended to deals with one or more free parameters and
derivation order 1 or higher.

The core elements are based on Dan Kalman paper "Recursive Multivariate
Automatic Differentiation", Mathematics Magazine, vol. 75, no. 3, June
2002. For efficiency, the recursive structure is compiled as simple
loops once for each pair (number of free parameters, derivation order).

This is work in progress, there are still some features missing even in
the most basic blocks (typically the asin, acos, atan, atant2 and taylor
methods in DSCompiler). There are also still no high level
differentiator implementation.

MATH-797
Initial version for Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules: the integration is
performed on the whole interval using a single rule. [Whereas the approach
used in class "analysis.integration.LegendreGaussIntegrator" is to divide
iteratively into sub-intervals (over which the integration rule is used)
until some covergence criterion is met.]
Adapted from an original code donated by Sébastien Brisard.
In the current implementation, the Gauss-Legendre rules are computed in
double precision in "LegendreRuleFactory" and high precision (using
"java.math.BigDecimal") in "LegendreHighPrecisionRuleFactory". However,
the "GaussIntegrator" class performs the integration using "double"s
whatever the precision of the rule.
The framework of "BaseRuleFactory" enables the addition of other quadrature
schemes (by overriding the "computeRule" method). [Sébastien's code already
provides Gauss-Chebyshev and Gauss-Hermite schemes (in double precision).]

MATH-795
  - Factored out testSerial().
  - In RealVectorTest, the vector returned by create(double[]) should really be
of type RealVectorTest.TestVectorImpl, as the minimal implementation is to be
tested. This causes some tests not to pass, they are skipped for the time
being (overriden from RealVectorAbstractTest, without @Test annotation). When
the tests in RealVectorAbstractTest are split, only the smaller tests which do
not make sense in the present context will be skipped.
  - In RealVectorTest, the constructor of RealVectorTest.TestVectorImpl now
makes a defensive copy of the specified double[] array (see Javadoc of
    + RealVectorAbstractTest.create(double[]),
    + RealVectorAbstractTest.createAlien(double[]).

Fixed a wrong assumption on BSP tree attributes.

The assumption was that the attribute was always a boolean when boundary
was empty. This assumption was false when emptiness resulted from a
collapsed boundary. Boolean attributes occur only at leaf nodes, so it
is the cut sub-hyperplane that needed to be checked.

In o.a.c.m3.SymmLQ.State
  - the current solution is now refined at each iteration, as the overhead is negligible
  - SymmLQ.State.xL is no longer a reference to the parameter x passed to its constructor. This way, all transparent updates of the vector x are removed.
  - SymmLQ.State.moveToCG(RealVector) is renamed SymmLQ.State.refineSolution(RealVector).
In o.a.c.m3.SymmLQ.solveInPlace()
  - SymmLQ.State.init() is now called explicitly
  - a new DefaultIterativeLinearSolverEvent is created each time it is needed (no "clever" object reuse)
  - SymmLQ.State.refineSolution(RealVector) is called explicitly
See MATH-761.

In SymmLQTest, testPreconditionedNormOfResidual() now passes.
Previous failure was due to the test itself, not to the implementation of SymmLQ.
See MATH-770.

In class o.a.c.math3.linear.SymmLQ
  - Changed parameter order for the constructor of nested class State (for consistency with the constructor of SymmLQ).
  - Moved some static helper methods from SymmLQ to nested class State
  - Changed visibility of some static fields from private to protected in order to avoid the use of synthetic getters.

Refactoring following the promotion of embedded class o.a.c.m.transform.FastFourierTransformer.RootsOfUnity to standalone class o.a.c.m.complex.RootsOfUnity
- computeOmega(int n) now computes exp(2 * pi * i * k / n), k = 0, ..., n - 1, instead of exp(-2 * pi * i * k / n) (which was more natural for FFT).
- isForward() does not mean anything outside the FFT context. It has been renamed isCounterClockwise(), which refers to the way the roots of unity are ordered.

Improved Dormand-Prince 8(5,3) step interpolator accuracy at step start.

The previous step is preserved and if interpolation time is in the first
half ot the step, then interpolation is based on step start, otherwise
is it based on step end. Previously, interpolation was always performed
with respect to step end.

If this trick proves useful, it will be extended to other Runge-Kutta
type step interpolators.

Fixed a bad interaction between step handlers and event handlers in ODE
integrators.

The problem was due to an internal array from the step interpolator that
was changed by the step handlers. These array was expected to contain
the state at event time, but was overridden later on. the solution is
simply to clone the array. Note that the fact the array is reused *is*
documented in the javadoc and is a feature of the interpolators ...

Added adapters for simple bounds constraints optimization.

The adapters are useful only for optimizers that do not support simple
bounds constraints by themselves (i.e. Nelder-Mead and Torczon's
multidirectional). Two adapters are available, one performs a mapping
between the whole real range and the bounded range (bounds being set
component wise), and one uses a penalty function.

Fixed an event resetting issue in ODE.

When several discrete events occur during the same ODE integration step,
they are handled chronologically or reverse chronologically depending on
the integration direction. If one of the event truncates the step (for
example because its eventOccurred method returns RESET or
RESET_DERIVATIVES for example), the stepAccepted method of the pending
events later in the step were not called. This implied that in the next
step, these events were still referring to data from previous step, they
had lost synchronization with the integrator.

Added checkstyle filter for declaration orders in FastMath.

FastMath uses very large tables which are located at end of class for
better readability. this is not a standard layout, but is well suited
for this case, hence we explicitly suppress checkstyle warning for these
tables.

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/trunk@1179948 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
Added checkstyle filter for exceptional catch of RuntimeException.

These catch occur in multi-start optimizers. The exceptions are caught
and stored, and if all restarts fail, then one of the stored
RuntimeException is rethrown. The purpose of multi-start is both to
allow some trials to fail and to avoid being trapped in a local
extremum. Catching RuntimeException is therefore mandatory here, and not
dangerous since we rethrow them as needed.

Modifications to the ConjugateGradient class and unit tests
  - altered the way iterations are counted: Incrementor is incremented prior to any modification to the current state, so that the solver is in a consistent state (accessible residual corresponds to the last estimate of the solution), even in case of MaxCountExceededException occuring.
  - modified some tests which were not testing anything.

MATH-650
Suggesting to use "resource" files for storing large tables.
"FastMathResource" is a utility for creating and loading those resources.
"FastMathLoadCheck" modified to allow the benchmarking of the various ways
to create the tables needed in "FastMath".
"FastMathResourcesSave" shows how to create the resource files (not a "user"
functionality, as this should be done only once): The resource files have
been created and are located under "src/main/resources/data".

keeping the requirement that the element must be strictly positive.

MATH-621

Change history:
 Constants in procedures replaced by static final fields.
 NF eliminated (function evaluation counting is done in base class).
 MAXFUN eliminated (exception is thrown by base class).
 -1e300 replaced by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
 1e300 replaced by POSITIVE_INFINITY.
 Number of interpolation points set at construction (no automatic default to "2n+1" if set to "-1").
 Replaced "checkParameters()" with "setup()" and moved validity checks from "doOptimize()" to "setup()".
 Replaced "boundaries[][]" with two "double[]" for the constraints.
 Removed unit test "testBoundariesNoData" ("null" is interpreted as "no constraints").
 Replaced "xl" and "xu" with "lowerBound" and "upperBound", respectively (Fortran 1-based indexing still used).
 Replaced "x" with "currentBest".
 Replaced "rhobeg" with "initialTrustRegionRadius". Using instance field directly instead of passing it as function argument.
 Replaced "rhoend" with "stoppingTrustRegionRadius". Using instance field directly instead of passing it as function argument.
 Removed all parameters from "bobyqa" function (using instance fields directly).
 Removed (from "bobyqa" function) a test on the bound difference: It would never fail because of the auto-correction in "setup".
 Replaced "ScopedPtr" by "FortranArray" for all one-dimensional data.
 0-based loop in "bobyqa".
 Replaced "ScopedPtr" by "FortranMatrix" for all matrix data.
 Loop-local counters in all functions.
 Replaced kopt with "trustRegionCenterInterpolationPointIndex" instance variable.
 Removed "ndim", "n" and "npt" from the arguments list of all functions.
 Removed "w" from the arguments list of "update".
 Removed "w" from the arguments list of "altmov" (replaced with local variables "work1" and "work2").
 In "trsbox" arguments list, replaced "ScopedPtr" ("gnew", "xbdi", "s", "hs", "hred") by "FortranArray".
 Removed "ptsaux", "ptsid" from arguments list of "rescue" (replaced with local variables).
 Corrected bug in "rescue" function.
 Removed "w" from arguments list of "rescue".
 Removed "glag" and "hcol" from arguments list of "altmov" (replaced by local variables).
 Removed "w" from arguments list of "bobyqb" (replaced by local variables).
 Removed global work space "w".
 Removed auxiliary class "ScopedPtr".
 Removed "alpha" and "cauchy" ("DoubleRef") in "altmov" arguments list: Values returned in a "double[]" array.
 Removed "dsq" and "crvmin" ("DoubleRef") in "trsbox" arguments list: Values returned in a "double[]" array.
 Removed "DoubleRef" auxiliary class.
 Removed unused local variables; changed some to be "final".

This is still an intermediate version. Please do not commit any changes

A complete generic implementation of Binary Space Partitioning Trees (BSP trees)
has been added. A few specializations of this implementation are also provided
for 1D, 2D and 3D Euclidean geometry. This allows support for arbitrary
intervals sets (1D), polygons sets (2D) and polyhedrons sets (3D) with all
sets operations (union, intersection, symmetric difference, difference, complement),
with predicates (point inside/outside/on boundary, emptiness, other region contained),
with geometrical computation (barycenter, size, boundary size) and with conversions
from and to boundary representation.

Fixed initialization of multistep ODE integrators. Relying on the interpolation model of the starter integrator inside only one step was wrong. The model may have a too low order to compute high degrees derivatives in the Nordsieck vector. Now we use several steps and use only grid points instead of interpolated points.

MATH-542
"MathRuntimeException" provides two ways for enhancing the information content:
one for localized messages and one for storing "context" objects.
The additional methods have been added to "MathThrowable". Consequently, dummy
implementations were needed in the old "MathRuntimeException" and
"MathException".
Some parts of the tests for old exceptions were removed as they used methods
that were deleted. A call to "MathUserException" in "AbstractContinuousDistribution"
was simplified for the same reason.
"MathUtils" still contained "String" (instead of "Localizable") as argument to
the constructor of a "MathArithmeticException".
I don't know why a test in "DummyStepInterpolatorTest" stopped working. It is now
commented out; please have a look.

"RealVectorFormat", "ComplexFormat", "Vector3DFormat" do not inherit anymore 
from the Java standard "Format". Removed methods that were mandated by this base
class (because they were not compatible with the new policy that CM should only
throw unchecked exceptions).
"CompositeFormat" now contains only static methods: Made it a utility class       
(i.e. with a "private" constructor).

MATH-447
New "MathRuntimeException" base class.
"MathUserException" shares the same functionality (and thus is made a subclass

Modified NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability to return 0 or 1,
respectively for values more than 40 standard deviations from the mean.
For these values, the actual probability is indistinguishable from 0 or 1
as a double.  Top coding improves performance for extreme values and prevents
convergence exceptions.

MATH-439
Refactored the "solvers" package. Implementations refer to number of
evaluation of the objective function (instead of the number of iterations).
New interfaces and base classes.
"NewtonSolver" fits in the design without resorting to a cast.
Created class "MullerSolver2" to contain the code of the method named "solve2"
in class "MullerSolver".
Removed "UnivariateRealSolverFactory" and "UnivariateRealSolverFactoryImpl".
Default solver in "UnivariateRealSolverUtils" is explicitely instantiated.
"AbstractContinuousDistribution": Type of exception thrown changed in
"UnivariateRealSolverUtils".
Factored out duplicate code (in "GaussNewtonOptimizerTest" and
"LevenbergMarquardtOptimizerTest"): class "Circle" is now called
"CircleVectorial". Also factored out the "Circle" class from
"NonLinearConjugateGradientOptimizerTest": class is named "CircleScalar".
Created "SecantSolverTest", moving there all the tests for the class
"SecantSolver" that were located in class "BrentSolverTest".
Created new interface and base class for polynomial functions solvers
("LaguerreSolver") so that the function type is now checked at compile time.
Removed deprecated exceptions (MATH-441).
Javadoc clean-up.
Lowered tolerance values in some unit tests.
Tests upgraded to Junit 4 (MATH-423).

MATH-430
New package "function" contains univariate and bivariate function objects.
"FunctionUtils" contains methods to compose and combine function objects.
Together they replace "ComposableFunction" and "BinaryFunction" which are
now deprecated.

removed FunctionEvaluationException, DerivativeException and MatrixVisitorException
these exception were  deprecated in 2.2 and a smooth transition path was set up to help users, now all user functions should use the new unchecked MathUserException

* Modified multiple regression newSample methods to ensure that by default in all cases,
  regression models are estimated with intercept terms.  Prior to the fix for this issue, 
  newXSampleData(double[][]), newSampleData(double[], double[][]) and 
  newSampleData(double[], double[][], double[][]) all required columns of "1's"
  to be inserted into the x[][] arrays to create a model with an intercept term;
  while newSampleData(double[], int, int) created a model including an intercept
  term without requiring the unitary column.  All methods have  been changed to
  eliminate the need for users to add unitary columns to specify regression models.

added the dfp library
The Dfp class represent the high precision numbers, it implements our existing Field interface and hence each instance is associated with a DfpField that provides the constants at the required precision as well as factory methods. This allowed to remove the compile-time constraint in the library. Users can even use at the same time a field for 20 decimals digits precision and another field for 100 digits precision. Dfp instances with different precision CANNOT be mixed in the same computation (doing so creates a NaN). A few utility methods have been added, like constructors from integral types, isInfinite and isNaN methods, equal has been renames to equals and its signature changed to match the general Object method (a hashcode method has been added too).

Resolved multiple problems leading to inaccuracy and/or failure to compute Normal, ChiSquare and 
Poisson probabilities, Erf and Gamma functions.

JIRA: MATH-282
JIRA: MATH-301

Summary of changes:

* BrentSolver has been changed to expose its configured absolute accuracy. This solver is used by
  the default inverse cum implementation in AbstractContinuousDistribution and the hard-coded setting
  (1E-6) was limiting accuracy in inverse cumulative probability estimates. AbstractContinuousDistribution
  was changed to allow distributions to set this value and NormalDistributionImpl was changed to set it to
  1E-9 by default and allow users to configure it via a constructor argument.

* AbstractContinuousDistribution and AbstractIntegerDistribution inverseCumulativeProbability methods
  have been modified to check for NaN values returned by cumulativeProbability and throw MathExceptions
  when this happens.

* The criteria for choosing between the Lanczos series and continued fraction expansion when computing
  regularized gamma functions has been changed to (x >= a + 1). When using the series approximation
  (regularizedGammaP), divergence to infinity is checked and when this happens, 1 is returned.

* When scaling continued fractions to (try to) avoid divergence to infinity, the larger of a and b is
  used as a scale factor and the attempt to scale is repeated up to 5 times, using successive powers
  of the scale factor.

* The maximum number of iterations used in estimating cumulative probabilities for PoissonDistributionImpl
  has been decreased from Integer.MAX_VALUE to 10000000 and made configurable.

Added a way to compute both the final state in an Initial Value Problem (IVP)
for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and its derivatives with respect to
initial state and with respect to some problem parameters. This allows wrapping
ODE solvers into optimization or root finding algorithms, which in turn can be
used to solve Boundary Value Problems (BVP). There are no implementations (yet)
of BVP solvers in the library.

Prevent NaN to occur for singular matrices
Numerical inaccuracies in the underlying eigendecomposition could induce
very small negative eigenvalues, so the square root produced NaNs. The
eigenvalues really cannot be negative, so it is safe to replace the negative
ones by 0.
There are remaining problems with singular matrices:
 - the singular vectors also contain NaNs
 - the solver does not really work in least square sense and
   complain about singular matrices

changing multistart behaviour to rely on search domain boundary rather than on start point
the only implementation of the raw minimizer ignores the start point so the multistart optimizer always found the same point before the change

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/trunk@795607 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68

Changed the default max growth factor for multistep methods using Nordsieck representation.
The previous value (10.0) was far too big and lead to numerical instability at high orders
because the last component of the Nordsieck vector, which has a low accuracy, could be
multiplied by 10^k which was ... huge.

These integrators are at least usable now!

The class itself is still not generic as this would prevent mixing types which is a desired feature here that is checked in the unit tests

However, should this really be serializable at all ?

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/trunk@786883 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
removed lots of serialization in ODE
the only classes/interfaces for which serialization is really important in this package are the step interpolators. The reason for that is that the ContinuousOutputModel is explicitly serializable and contains step interpolators. This allows users to perform integration of any complex model and to save the result of the integration for all integration range by serializing a ContinuousOutputModel instance. This feature is a major one.

completely changed integration start phase: now the starter integrator for
multistep methods do not advance time anymore, it is interrupted at first step
end and the interpolator is used to reconstruct Nordsieck vector information at
integration start. Then the normal multistep integrators does start also exactly
at integration start and is responsible for all time advancing stuff, including
step handlers and events handlers management.

More Serialization changes, mostly for ode and friends.

Unfortunately, had to leave some abstract base classes as Serializable, since they had no senible default construters.  But left them with meaningless UIDs, to break anyone that doesn't override it.

Of course, if anyone has a better patch, I'm happy to implement it.  At this point, the serialization changes for [math] should be almost done.

completely redesigned Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton integrators
they are now provided by a single class and use the Nordsieck form
with higher derivatives at current step instead of classical form
with only first derivatives but at several steps.
The implementation is simpler for both the integrators and the step
interpolator and it allows a future enhancement with adaptive stepsize.

separated iteration counter from function evaluation counters,
some optimizers are based on gradient/jacobian only and cannot
reliably be protected by monitoring the objective function calls.

We now have two or three counters for each algorithm:

 - objective function evaluations, for user information only
 - objective function gradient/jacobian if the function is
   differentiable, for user information only

continued refactoring of optimization framework:
 - improved general interfaces at top optimization level
 - added a simple implementation of ConvergenceChecker (ObjectiveValueChecker)
 - added a general multi-start wrapper
 - changed the direct search optimizers to the new interfaces

are very close to the former design, they have almost not been changed
structurally.

Failed attempt to implement Strassen matrix multiplication on recursive layout as
described in Siddhartha Chatterjee, Alvin R. Lebeck, Praveen K. Patnala and Mithuna
Thottehodi paper "Recursive Array Layout and Fast Matrix Multiplication".

As of 2009-02-13, this implementation does not work! The padding at left and bottom
sides of the matrix should be cleared after some operations like scalerAdd and is not.
Also there is a limitation in the multiplication that can only process matrices with
sizes similar enough to have the same power of two number of tiles in all three
matrices A, B and C such that C = A*B. These parts have not been fixed since the
performance gain with respect to DenseRealMatrix are not very important, and the
numerical stability is poor.

This may well be due to a bad implementation.

This code has been put in the experimental directory for the record, putting it into
production would require solving all these issues.

Added method to walk matrix entries with or without changing them in the
visitor design pattern sense. Two different orders can be used, row by row
of following internal storage. Internal order should be preferred when no
specific order is needed, because it will be more cache efficient.

prepared interface for general eigendecomposition
we currently support only symmetric matrices and real eigenvalues
Jira issue MATH-235 asks for asymmetric matrices support, which needs
an API adaptation.
Preparing the interface yet avoids introducing incompatibility later.
The current status is explained in javadoc and matrix symmetry is checked
at runtime with an InvalidMatrixException triggered if asymmetry is detected.

completed implementation of EigenDecompositionImpl.
The implementation is now based on the very fast and accurate dqd/dqds algorithm.
It is faster than Jama for all dimensions and speed gain increases with dimensions.
The gain is about 30% below dimension 100, about 50% around dimension 250 and about
65% for dimensions around 700.
It is also possible to compute only eigenvalues (and hence saving computation of
eigenvectors, thus even increasing the speed gain).

added a first version of eigen decomposition implementation
this version is not finished yet, but it does work when
eigenvalues are well separated and is faster than JAMA for
dimensions above 100.
It still needs work as the MRRR algorithm is not implemented
yet (only the basic parts with twisted factorization is there).
I continue working on this, but wanted to have a first version
committed to let people play with it and as a basis for comparison.

New ODE integrators have been added: the explicit Adams-Bashforth and implicit

improved robustness in case of events just at integration start

When an event occurs exactly at integration start, the first truncated
steps ends up with zero size. This induced problems with forward/backward
sensing based on this step alone. This also induced an infinite loop in
the calling integrators.

introduced an upper level interface for all ODE integrators

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/branches/MATH_2_0@674821 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
introduced an upper level interface for all ODE integrators

The ODE integrators now support several step handlers at once, instead of just one.
This is more consistent with event handlers management.
The setStepHandler method has therefore been replaced by addStephandler, the
getStepHandler method has been replaced by getStepHandlers which returns a Collection
and a clearStepHandlers method has been added.

renamed AbstractStepInterpolatorTest into StepInterpolatorAbstractTest
to match existing maven exclusion patterns

added a common abstract class for testing time-derivatives consistencies in step interpolators

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/branches/MATH_2_0@673762 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
All step interpolators for ODE integrators now provide interpolation for
both the state and its time derivatives. The interpolated derivatives are
the exact derivatives of the interpolated state, thus preserving consistency.
The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function
anymore. The fixed step handlers also get the time derivative of the state
as an additional argument along with the state when they are called.

added a way to retrieve the meta-data associated with event handlers
(max iteration count, convergence, check interval)

added a top-level AbstractIntegrator class to manage events and step handlers

git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/math/branches/MATH_2_0@673069 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
added missing keywords

Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.integrate() to double
in order to retrieve exact stop time. This allows to handle properly
integration interruption due to an EventHandler instance asking to
stop the integration when its associated event is triggered. The state
was already set to the current state at interruption time, but it was
difficult to get the corresponding time (it involved setting a step
handler monitoring the last step specially).

clarified the ODE package by breaking in into several sub-packages and renaming
classes. This also prepares future work for non-stiff solvers.

SwitchingFunctions is now known as EventHandler
SwitchingFunctionsHandler is now known as CombinedEventsManager

The user manual as also been slightly improved, both to reflect these changes
and to make it easier to grasp the underlying principles in our implementation
of ODE solving

Changed return type for FirstOrderIntegrator.getSwitchingFunctions()
to a collection of SwitchingFunction instances. This better suits the
intended use of the method and fixes a visibility error since the
previous return type referenced the package private SwitchState class.

Improved usability of the geometry package.
From a developer point of view, all the changes are related.
From a user point of view, they are independent changes.

 - added several convenience methods for Vector3D and Rotation
 - replaced public no argument constructors with IDENTITY or ZERO
   static instances for immutable classes Vector3D and Rotation
 - fixed inconsistencies in the naming scheme for static fields in
   Vector3D and Rotation with respect to the overall library

avoid array copy

Improved linear RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl performances.
The main changes are the following ones:
 - use directly the storage array when possible for
   diadic operations (add, subtract, multiply), as
   suggested by Phil, this avoids the cost of the
   generic getEntry method
 - replaced custom indices checks by simple use of
   the JVM checks and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
 - put row arrays reference in local variables to
   avoid multiple checks in double loops
 - use final variables where possible
 - removed unneeded array copying
 - added a constructor to build a matrix from an
   array without copying it where it makes sense

The speed gain is about 3X for multiplication. Performances
for this operation are now on par with Jama.

COMMONSSITE-30 - fix the checkstyle configuration to work for multi-module and review/update <reporting> plugin version numbers for the poms being changed.
 - pom's need to use ${basedir} for configuration files as the multi-module profile is run from commons-parent, so if not specified it can't find those files
 - the checkstyle configuration file needs to use ${checkstyle.header.file} for the headerFile property and  <headerFile> element added to the plugin config in the pom.xml

Configured checkstyle to stop complaining about incomplete Javadoc in some very specific cases.

This problem has been discussed previously here:
  http://markmail.org/message/pmbiyiqssjesq7tm

The solution implemented with this modification is to configure checkstyle
in such a way the errors can be filtered out using dedicated comments in the
source code:

  // CHECKSTYLE: stop JavadocMethodCheck

  // a bunch of functions known to trigger warnings
  // that we explicitly REFUSE to fix

  // CHECKSTYLE: resume JavadocMethodCheck

The checks are still performed normally in file parts not bracketed by
these comments. Hence the first few methods in o.a.c.m.stat.inference.TestUtils are
still checked for correct javadoc, and only for the last ones in the same files
are the checks relaxed.

Replaced Raw types by Parameterized types where appropriate.
The various ArrayList, HashSet and HashMap used in math have
be restricted to the content they are intended for.
This removes lots of warnings that have appeared after the
switch to Java 5, and improves safety (for example the categories
used by OneWayAnova are guaranteed to be double arrays at compile
time).
Two difficult cases where not handled here: the Frequency class
and the Fitness interface. The first one mixes types and needs to
be studied before any change is attempted. The second one generates
some side effects on the overall package which is still under development.

 * URLs that shouldn't change (DOCTYPE fragments etc.)
 * Test cases where namespace URLs matter etc. (I'll track any related nightly failures)

- Changed Vector3D and Rotation to immutable classes for ease of use
- Improved some javadoc in class Rotation

Modify maven build to add two non-standard attributes to the jar's manifest file to indicate the values of "maven.compile.source" and "maven.compile.target". Also modify the build to include an "Implementation-Vendor-Id" of "org.apache" in the jar's manifest.

The two non-standard entires created in the manifest file will look something like the following:

X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.3
X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.3

This change serves two purposes:

  1) To provide comfort to users regarding JVM compatibility.
  2) Enable releases to be checked more easily for JVM compatibility.

The manifest specification indicates that "unknown" entries in the manifest file are ignored. These entries have been prefixed with "X-" which is a sometimes used "convention" for indicating non-standard entries.

Pre Issue 29012, getKurtosisClass() did not have a tolerance; therefore,
any non-zero kurtosis was consistently mesokurtic.  Instead of getting 
into this level of detail, getKurtosisClass() has been removed, it is a
subjective measure not appropriate for DescStat.

When this was iriginally done, it was agreed that pointing to a SNAPSHOT was not an option for a release.

Here's my idea for approximating derivatives.  It follows the decorator layout of commons-collections.  The main interface point is the UnivariateRealFunctionUtils type which is responisble for creating decorated UnivariateRealFunction objects.  To demostrate the how the decorators could be used, I added the UnivariateRealFunctionUtilsTest class which computes a local maximum of a function using derivative decorators and the default solver.

This directory will not get compiled into the regular build process or future distributions. We can work on an ant script to provide easy build of this if others think it neccessary.

Rewrite StatUtils to use static instances of UnivariateStatistics. Benefits? 

1.) In the future, when we establish "Factories" for these objects, we'll be able to plug implementations in, even under our static Utilities classes for these functions. 

2.) The  user can always rely on the same result, whether using the StaticUtil, Univariate Container or direct UnivariateStatistic.

In cases where "getResult" contains a statistical calculation, it now 
checks if the internal state of the underlying statistic has changed 
and only recalculates if this is true. this way muliple calls to getResult 
when the staistic has not been incremented are less expensive 
because it is only returning a property value.

Its more logical not to have increment return a value, this allows a 
distict separation between the calculation of moments and the 
calculation of the actually return value of getVlaue in Storageless 
approaches. With this benifit it is no longer neccessary to calculate 
all the statistics moment based statistics on addValue, only the 
underlying moment itself.

This house-cleaning improves UnivariateImpl, in a number of ways.

1.) insertValue is abolished and its contents are now in addValue

2.) UnivariateImpl now extends AbstractStoredUnivariate to deligate to
 those methods directly for calculating statistics when storage is active, all methods
 deligate to AbstractStoreUniv when the DoubleArray is no longer null. This also means
that a majority of the StoreUnivariate interface is now implemented in Univariate to provide
deligates when storage is active, and to throw runtime exceptions when its not (this at least until 
we establish rolling implementations for those methods). We should consider consolidating the 
StoreUnivariate interface into the Univariate interface

3.) Calculations in addValue have been reorganized, only calculations for
the storageless solution are now present in this class. otherwise the value is 
added/Rolling to the Double array when appropriate.

I'm satisfied that it passes all Unit tests.

Addition of a BeanListUnivariateImpl which can gather univariate statistics on a
List of JavaBeans.  This implementation extends the ListUnivariateImpl, and uses the
PropertyUtils classes from commons-beanutils.  With this implementation, the following
is possible:

List persons = new ArrayList();
// populate array with 100 persons
Univariate ageU = new BeanListUnivariateImpl( persons, "age" );
Univariate incomeU = new BeanListUnivariateImpl( persons, "jobInfo.income" );
System.out.println( "Mean age is: " + ageU.getMean() );
System.out.println( "Mean income is: " + incomeU.getMean() );

Better error handling is needed near our use of PropertyUtils.

This patch introduces a dependency on commons-beanutils, which in turn depends
on commons-collections and commons-logging.

* a distribution factory following the abstract factory pattern.
The value being, if users want to swap out the default distribution
implementations with their own, why stop them.  The factory is responsible for
create the distribution instances (only continuous ones for now).

* Each distribution has a cummulativeProbabilty method which returns the value of
the CDF for a given value.  By default, via the abstract distribution base
class, an inverseCummulativeProbability method is all provided for all
distributions.  It's implementation is generically handled by applying root
finding techniques to the cummulativeProbability method.  That way, when new
distributions are added, authors only need to create the CDF method and the
inverse is provided automatically.

* Currenty, the only distributions are Chi-Squared and Gamma (one actually since
Chi-Squared is a specialized Gamma) but more are planned.

An implementation of ordinary least squares regression with one independent
variable. The implementation uses running sums and does not require the data
to be stored in memory.  Since I could not conceive of any significantly
different implementation strategies that did not amount to just improving
efficiency or numerical accuracy of what I am submitting, I did not abstract
the interface.

The test cases validate the computations against NIST reference data and
verified computations. The slope, intercept, their standard errors and
r-square estimates are accurate to within 10E-12 against the reference data
set.  MSE and other ANOVA stats are good at least to within 10E-8. -- Phil S.

From Phil Steitz patch submission for Issue #20175

The attached patch includes the following improvements to Univariate and
UnivariateImpl:

* Improved efficiency of min, max and product maintenance when windowSize is
  limited by incorporating suggestion posted to commons-dev by Brend Worden
  (added author credit).  Thanks, Brent!

* Added javadoc specifying NaN contracts for all statistics, definitions for
  geometric and arithmetic means.

* Made some slight modifications to UnivariateImpl to make it consistent with
  NaN contracts

* All interface documentation moved to Univariate. The interface specification
  includes the NaN semantics and a first attempt at clealy defining exactly
  what "rolling" means and how this effects what statistics are defined when.

* Added test cases to verify that min, max, product are correctly maintained
  when "rolling" and to verify that NaN contracts are satisfied.

Commited patch for issue 20112 from Phil Steitz.

EmpiricalDistribution -- represents an empirical probability distribution and
supports generation of data values that are "like" values in an input file
without making any assumptions about the functional form of the probability
distribution that the data come from.   This is useful in simulation
applications where historical data about component performance are
available but do not follow standard distributions (or any application that
requires random data generation from an empirical distribution). Also
generates data for grouped frequency histograms based on the input file.

ValueServer -- a wrapper for RandomData and EmpiricalDistribution that
generates values in each of the following modes:
  * DIGEST_MODE -- uses an empirical distribution
  * REPLAY_MODE -- replays data from an input file
  * UNIFORM_MODE -- generates uniformly distributed random values
  * EXPONENTIAL_MODE -- generates exponentially distributed random
                        values
  * GAUSSIAN_MODE -- generates Gaussian distributed random values
  * CONSTANT_MODE -- returns the same value every time.

* One should be able to use a DoubleArray in a similar way to a
regular double[], to this effect methods for accessing element
values will no longer throw NoSuchElementExceptions when an
index is outside of the element set.  These method all throw
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException if a bad index is supplied.

* Filled out javadoc in FixedDoubleArray.

This commit contains the suite of random data generation utilities that
I originally
proposed as extensions to lang.math.  There is some functional overlap
with lang.math, but the contract and intention of this implementation is
different in several significant ways.

* the lang implementation maintains "immutability" of the underlying
   random number generator (emulating Math). The RandomData
   implementation allows users to reseed the random number generator(s)
   (this is in effect possible in the recent extensions to lang.math by
   passing in a user-supplied random as an actual parameter to the
   next() methods) Users can also reset the PRNG algorithm and provider
   used by the "secure" methods.

* RandomData includes "secure" methods (delegating to SecureRandom)

* RandomData will generate random deviates from exponential and poisson,
   as well as Gaussian and Uniform distributions.  These are useful in
   simulation applications.

* Overlapping somewhat with lang.StringUtils, RandomData will generate
   random hex strings.  There is a nextSecureHexString method that will
   (I claim :-) generate cryptographically secure string identifiers. I
   would appreciate feedback on this algorithm, which I have seen used
   elsewhere (similar to what tomcat does to generate session ids); but
   not documented as a standard.

The Univariate interface now contains getWindow and setWindow in
addition to a constant which signifies an "infinite" window.  Windowing
has been added to all three Univariate implementations:

* UnivariateImpl - If the window is not infinite, we keep track of
0..n elements and discount the contribution of the discarded element when
our "window" is moved.  If the window is infinite no extra storage is used
beyond an empty ContractableDoubleArray.

- In the following two implementations, the window size can be changed at anytime.

* ListStoreUnivariateImpl - If the window is not infinite, this
implementation only takes into account the last n elements of the List.

* StoreUnivariateImpl - Uses an internal ContractableDoubleArray, window size
can be changed at any time.

* DoubleArray is now an interface which is implemented by
ExpandableDoubleArray.  The interface provides a public interface
which does not hint at any of the storage parameters of
Expandable or Contractable.

* DoubleArrayTest now operates on the DoubleArray interface, casting
to Expandable when we need to call the package scopes getInternalLength
method.

* While we should not provide access to the internal storage array, it
should be possible to obtain a double[] of elements stored in this
DoubleArray - double[] getElements() was added to the DoubleArray interface,
it will return the element array.


git-svn-id: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/math/trunk@140834 13f79535-47bb-0310-9956-ffa450edef68
* ContractableDoubleArray extends ExpandableDoubleArray - I sense the
need for a DoubleArray interface.

* ExpandableDoubleArray and the extension ContractableDoubleArray should
aim towards presenting a public interface that does not expose any
details of the internal.  To this end, one is no longer able to get the
internal storage array via public double[] getValues(), and the startIndex
(which was relative to the internal storage array) is no longer available.

* [Expandable|Contractable]DoubleArray now allow one to discard
elements from the front of the array.  Before this commit, one could
accomplish the same goal by changing the starting index of the element
array within the internal storage array.  This solution allowed one to
discard elements from the front of the array (as well as) reclaiming
elements by decreases the startIndex.

There were two problems with this approach (especially in
ContractableDoubleArray).   The ContractableDoubleArray can be
"compacted" at anytime thereby reseting the startIndex to zero and the
size of the internal store array to number of elements plus one.  Second,
"reclaiming" elements from the internal storage array by finagling
internal "pointers" to the start and end index seems to violate the
principles of encapsulation.  If you "discard" an element from the
front of the array, consider it unavailable.

It should be noted that calling setNumElements allows one to move the end
index of the internal element array at will.  Assume one has a 100 element
array, and one calls setNumElements(10), thereby decreasing the ending index
of the element array by 90.  The 90 "dumped" elements are not currently
reinitializied to the default double primitive value.  This is an open
question.

* Tests for ExpandableDoubleArray and ContractableDoubleArray were
refactored.  both test classes now extend a DoubleArrayAbstractTest
JUnit class which contained shared unit tests for both "implementations".
An approach like this should be adopted to test the Univariate implementations.

Made a nubmer of change to the ExpandableDoubleArray.

* This class now supports
the ability to move the starting index of the internal element array.  This
allows one to move the beginning of the element array, and form a sort of
"window", this will come into play when we want to provide moving
averages, or "rolling".

* Added an addElementRolling(double v) - this will increment the startIndex
and add the element to the end of the internal element array

* brought the Clover test cases up to 100% for this class

Added a class ContractableDoubleArray:

* This is an extension of ExpandableDoubleArray - it addes a configuration
parameter contractionCriteria.  Essential if the contractionCriteria is
2.0f we commit to never having the internal storage array provide more
than 2.0 times the storage capacity needed.  Once the internal
storage array exceed this measurement, the internal storage array is
pruned to the size of the internal element array.

Also, my IDE scolded me for some ununsed imports in ListUnivariateImpl, they
have been removed.

Another change to the stored Univariates.  The calculations are now abstracted
into an AbstractStoreUnivariate class which take responsibility for
all statistical calculations.  AbstractStoreUnivariate is implemented by
two classes:

* StoreUnivariateImpl - This class uses a ExpandableDoubleArray for
internal storage.  This class is a more efficient class in terms
of storage and cycles for users who are interested in gathering statistics
not available in the UnivariateImpl implementation.

* ListUnivariateImpl - This class is for a situation where a user might
wish to maintain a List of numeric objects outside of a StoreUnivariate
instance.  We still need to add serious error checking in the absence of
1.5's generics, but this implementation will work with any list that
contains Number objects - (BigDecimal, BigInteger, Byte, Double, Float,
Integer, Long, Short).  This implementation ultimately transforms all
numeric objects into double primitives via Number.doubleValue().

Becuase AbstractStoreUnivariate does not hold on to any state, a user
can add values through the Univariate.addValue() function OR one can
directly manipulate the contents of the List directly.

The following changes were made to the Univariate implementation.  The public
interface of Univariate was extracted in an interface of the same name.
Univariate, an interface, is now implemented by UnivariateImpl which contains
all code originally present in the original Univariate implementation.

* StoredUnivariate is an interface which extends Univariate and adds
measures not available in the superinterface such as mode, kurtosis, and skew

* StoredUnivariateImpl provides an implementation which uses the
ExpandableDoubleArray for internal storage.  Calculations are performed
on demand *each* time a particular measure is required no state is
maintained by this implementation.

* Univariate provided methods addValue(int), addValue(float), addValue(long).
There functions were removed as no cast is required - all of these
assignments are widening conversions - no cast required

* Removed the name property from Univariate - property not relevant to
univariate statistics
