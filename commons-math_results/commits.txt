ccf6befd5 1. Make RealMatrixImpl implement Serializable 2. Make all currently unimplemented methods throw UnsupportedOperationException 3. Add solve() method to RealMatrix interface, representing vector    solution to AX = B, where B is the parameter and A is *this.
f039b677b Added an expandable double array, this class simply contains a double[] and takes care of automatic expansion of an internal array when necessary.  Class added with accompanying unit test
97568dc06 The following changes were made to the Univariate implementation.  The public interface of Univariate was extracted in an interface of the same name. Univariate, an interface, is now implemented by UnivariateImpl which contains all code originally present in the original Univariate implementation.
52590a7d0 Submitted by: Phil S. Reviewed by: Tim O.
5ae92f12c Another change to the stored Univariates.  The calculations are now abstracted into an AbstractStoreUnivariate class which take responsibility for all statistical calculations.  AbstractStoreUnivariate is implemented by two classes:
5f2a1cbbc Made a nubmer of change to the ExpandableDoubleArray.
065a88e24 Patches from Phil S. applied:
7651a6b14 * ContractableDoubleArray extends ExpandableDoubleArray - I sense the need for a DoubleArray interface.
0700b0f48 * DoubleArray is now an interface which is implemented by ExpandableDoubleArray.  The interface provides a public interface which does not hint at any of the storage parameters of Expandable or Contractable.
71dfdabde The Univariate interface now contains getWindow and setWindow in addition to a constant which signifies an "infinite" window.  Windowing has been added to all three Univariate implementations:
d6f702826 Added a FixedDoubleArray.  FixedDoubleArray supports a rolling mechanism that reuses an array of fixed length.  This classes was added to an efficient rolling mechanism.
5879d3be8 Altered the build script to use batch test instead of running a suite.  The advantage of this is that when new tests are added to the project a TestSuite class does not need to updated.

9a827be03 Removing more of my author tags.
7ec4d3874 Its more logical not to have increment return a value, this allows a distict separation between the calculation of moments and the calculation of the actually return value of getVlaue in Storageless approaches. With this benifit it is no longer neccessary to calculate all the statistics moment based statistics on addValue, only the underlying moment itself.
297d2ca68 This is an attempt to get directories working properly in .cvsignore
519237327 actually this is ok, its a problem with the fact that the directory already exists in the cvs.
fe37437c0 In cases where "getResult" contains a statistical calculation, it now checks if the internal state of the underlying statistic has changed and only recalculates if this is true. this way muliple calls to getResult when the staistic has not been incremented are less expensive because it is only returning a property value.

dda3ec944 Project dependencies for commons-collctions and commons-lang were pointing to the SNAPSHOT of both.  When this was iriginally done, it was agreed that pointing to a SNAPSHOT was not an option for a release.  Now that compatible version of these to component have been released, the versions have been updated.  Commons Math now depends on collections 2.1 and lang 2.0.
